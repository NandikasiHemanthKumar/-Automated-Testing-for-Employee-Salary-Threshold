The objective of this mini project is to develop an automated testing framework 
for verifying the functionality of determining employees whose salaries surpass 
a predefined threshold. The automation process involves creating test cases that 
simulate various scenarios, such as different salary thresholds, empty employee 
lists, and boundary cases. These test cases will be executed automatically using 
testing frameworks like Selenium or Appium, coupled with scripting languages 
such as Java.
